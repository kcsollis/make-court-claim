          <p>You can ask the court to collect payment from the person or business who owes you money (the ‘debtor’) if they do not pay you after receiving the court order. </p>

          <p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fees-in-the-civil-and-family-courts-main-fees-ex50">pay a court fee </a>when you ask the court to collect the payment.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Find out what the debtor can afford to pay</h2>

          <p>Ask the court to <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n316-application-for-order-that-debtor-attend-court-for-questioning">order the debtor to attend court</a> to provide evidence of their income or spending, for example bills and statements.</p>

          <p>If the money is owed by a business, you can ask for an <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n316a-application-for-order-that-officer-of-the-debtor-company-attend-court-for-questioning">officer from the company</a> to attend court and give details of its accounts.</p>
          
          <p>You can then decide if you want the court to take further action to collect your payment.</p>

          <p>You cannot enforce a judgement if you’re told that the person who owes you money has got a ‘Breathing Space’ and is temporarily protected from their creditors. Find out about <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/debt-respite-breathing-space-scheme-creditors-responsibilities-to-the-court">your responsibilities and what you need to tell the court during a ‘Breathing Space’.</a></p>
          
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Send bailiffs to collect payment</h2>

          <p>You can ask the court to send bailiffs to collect the money. This is called a <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-ask-for-a-warrant-of-control-ex322">'warrant of control’.</a></p>

          <p>The bailiff will ask for payment within 7 days. If the debt is not paid, the bailiff will visit the debtor’s home or business to see if anything can be sold to pay the debt.</p>

          <p>You can apply to either a county court or the High Court if you’re owed between £600 and £5,000.</p>

          <p>You may need legal advice if you apply at the High Court.</p>

          <p>How you apply to the court depends on how you made your claim.</p>

          <p>The court will do this by sending an order to the debtor’s employer.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Freeze assets or money in an account</h2>

          <p>You can ask the court to freeze money in the debtor’s bank, building society or business account. This is called a <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n337-request-for-attachment-of-earnings-order">‘third-party debt order’.</a></p> 

          <p>The court will decide if money from the account can be used to pay the debt.</p>

          <p>If the land or property is sold, the debtor must pay this charge before they get their money.</p>
